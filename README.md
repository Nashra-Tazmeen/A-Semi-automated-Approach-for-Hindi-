# A-Semi-automated-Approach-for-Hindi-Neologism
Project Title: A Semi-Automated approch for Hindi Neologism

Description: The Semi-Automated Hindi Neologism Identification project aims to identify newly coined or emerging words in the Hindi language, particularly those related to contemporary topics such as COVID-19. The project utilizes text processing techniques and existing linguistic resources to identify potential neologisms.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: Hindi text data is collected from various online sources using web crawling techniques. Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, such as punctuation, stop words, and English words, to focus solely on Hindi text. Neologism Identification: Existing Hindi dictionaries and linguistic resources are used to identify known words. Words not found in these resources are considered potential neologisms.
Ranking: Neologisms are ranked based on factors like frequency of occurrence, relevance to the COVID-19 context, and other linguistic criteria.

Manual Review: Human intervention is required to review the top-ranked candidate words to confirm if they are indeed neologisms related to COVID-19.

Expected Output: The project outputs a list of potential neologisms, ranked according to their relevance and frequency of occurrence in the processed Hindi text corpus. These neologisms serve as valuable insights into emerging vocabulary in the Hindi language, especially concerning contemporary events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
